the skin needs to have its php "adding skin elements" in this order for at least the first few items, nav/login/page manipulation positions are completely dictated by css.  content needs to be ordered to the very top of the body tags.

to do:
fix search, its a complete mess, both nav & search page search forms are in need of fixing.  suggestions are totally out of control, and using terrible inline styles, that's a bug in mw's core.

cdn bootstrap instead of local is a possibility, ill look further into that later.

when done with funtoo's bootstrapping, http://foundation.zurb.com/index.html duplicate effort of this?  then http://960.gs/ then http://unsemantic.com/ ?????
