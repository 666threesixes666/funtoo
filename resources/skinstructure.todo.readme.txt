the skin needs to have its php "adding skin elements" in this order for at least the first few items, nav/login/page manipulation positions are completely dictated by css.  content needs to be ordered to the very top of the body tags.

how should i do nav?  name/logo, sidebar, page controls, user controls, search float right?  something like that?

to do:
fix footer links

clean up navbar extra html items from testing

fix search, its a complete mess, both nav & search page search forms are in need of fixing.

when done with funtoo's bootstrapping, http://foundation.zurb.com/index.html duplicate effort of this?  then http://960.gs/ then http://unsemantic.com/ ?????
